### Assignment 4
#### Calculation of a debt repayment with recurring payments
This is the reverse of assignments 2 and 3

Calculate how long it will take to completely pay off a debt if regular payments are made.  Note that each year, the debt will increase by the amount of loan interest, but will decrease with youre recurring payment. 

Criteria:
Your program should ask the user for
* an initial debt
* the annual interest rate
* the annual payment
* the program will state how long it will take for the debt to be repaid.
* extra: Calculate the total amount of interest that is paid along with the debt repayment

Sample:
Joey takes a car loan to buy a new Tesla for $62000
The loan has an annual interest rate of .75% per month.  He makes monthly payments of $1000.
How many months will it take him to pay off the car.  How much interest has he paid in that time?

84 months
He will have paid 21711.60 in interest
